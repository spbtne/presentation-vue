            What is Vue? Vue.js is an open source JavaScript framework for
            creating user interfaces. Easily integrated into projects using
            other JavaScript libraries. It can function as a web framework that
            helps develop advanced one-page applications, web interfaces and can
            also be used for mobile and desktop app development with the
            Electron framework.

            His job at Google involved a lot of prototyping in the browser. He
            had this idea and wanted to get something tangible as fast as
            possible. Some of the projects used Angular at that time. Angular
            offered something cool which is data binding and a data driven way
            of dealing with a DOM, so you don‚Äôt have to touch the DOM yourself.
            It also brought in all these extra concepts that forced you to
            structure the code the way it wanted you to. But it felt too heavy.
            So he figured, what if he will extract the part that he liked about
            Angular and build something lightweight without all the extra
            concepts involved? He was also curious as to how its internal
            implementation worked. He started this experiment just trying to
            replicate this minimal feature set, like declarative data binding.
            That was basically how Vue started.

          <img class="fade-in" src="./assets/virtual_DOM.png" width="800px" />
          <aside class="notes">
            When rendering web pages, chances are pretty good that you‚Äôll run
            into a DOM or a Document Object Model. This model represents the
            HTML pages with all styles, page content, and elements as objects
            which are stored as a tree structure and during page loading, they
            are generated by the browser. When instances of user interaction
            happen with the page, the objects change their own state and the
            browser has to update the info changes and also, render it on the
            display. The only problem with this is that updating the entire DOM
            can be a cumbersome process. So to improve the process, Vue.js uses
            a virtual DOM, a copy of the website‚Äôs original DOM, that the
            framework uses for figuring out element updates without having to
            render the entire DOM, thus improving app performance and making
            page rendering rather quick. Better performance and overall speed is
            a crucial key point for most developers when it comes to choosing
            the ideal framework.

            Vue stores another DOM-manipulation benefit, that is known as
            two-way data binding. Vue inherited this feature from Angular. It
            basically describes the connection between model data updates and
            the view (UI), with bound components containing data that you can
            update from time to time. With two-way data binding, updating
            related components and tracking data updates in general, becomes
            easier. Bound data receives reactive updates in Vue just like DOM
            objects. This feature makes the framework ideal for applications
            with real-time updates.

          <aside class="notes">
            Vue uses components to build your web page, meaning that every piece
            of your application is a different component that represents an
            encapsulated element of the interface itself. These components can
            be written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML without the need to divide
            them into separate files. Application code-splitting is an approach
            utilized in CBA, or Component-Based Architecture, and are key
            features in such contenders as React or Angular. <br />
            An architecture with traits like this also means a couple of
            benefits: <br />
            Reusable Components ‚Äì the encapsulated components can be referred to
            as code chunks that developers can reuse as templates for similar
            elements.
            <br />
            Great Unit-testing ‚Äì the testing process is configured as a
            QA-activity that checks how the smallest parts perform in the app on
            their own. The component-based approach greatly simplifies this
            process. <br />
            Code Reading ‚Äì Every component is stored in separate files (with
            each component being a single file), making code readability a lot
            easier. This feature makes the application easier to maintain and
            can take a lot of guesswork out of troubleshooting.

            Being able to integrate new tech with existing apps is a crucial
            feature for every software and Vue.js makes this process a breeze
            because it only needs JavaScript to work and needs no other tools.
            In Vue, you can write templates using JS, HTML, or a JavaScript
            syntax extension called JSX. On the other hand, if developers decide
            to make a shift from Angular or React to Vue, the transition won‚Äôt
            be a problem since it‚Äôs basically a mixture of the two making for a
            familiar platform out of the box. Apart from great integration and
            flexibility, Vue also boasts a great ecosystem with a powerful set
            of handy tools that can make development streamlined, quick, and a
            great experience.

            1.Truth be told, complex and hard to learn tools rarely get
            immensely popular. Vue doesn‚Äôt require programmers to have years and
            years of prior experience in coding, in-depth library knowledge,
            TypeScript, and JSX, as it is with the majority of other front-end
            frameworks and technologies. According to the professionals, Vue
            only requires developers to know the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and
            CSS to get started and take it from there. As a bonus, Atom, Sublime
            Text and Visual Studio (some of the most popular code editors) all
            support Vue, which means that giving the framework a try can be even
            easier. <br />
            2.The documentation is structured well, and covers a vast number of
            topics, guiding through the user everything from installation to
            more complex processes like app scaling and reactivity. The
            documentation even features sections where it compares Vue to other
            JS frameworks pointing out differences and things in common. This
            feature can come insanely handy for developers with prior experience
            with JavaScript frameworks who need or wish to transit to
            Vue.Documentation has nine translation<br />
            3.vuemastery As the ultimate resource for Vue.js developers, Vue
            Mastery produces weekly lessons so you can learn what you need to
            succeed as a Vue.js Developer. <br />
            vueschool teach Vue.js and JavaScript through video courses.
            <br />
            4. Vue has great community support with active community members who
            are always ready to help everyone who‚Äôs facing issues during the
            development process. Great community support and documentation are
            also important features of every successful framework.
            <br />
            5. Some developers doubted the success of View, as only one person
            worked on it. Now a large team of developers around the world are
            contributing to the development of the project, which makes it even
            stronger every day.
